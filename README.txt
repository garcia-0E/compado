1. Advantages and Disadvantages of the Tech Stack in terms of Automation, Maintenance, and SEO Performance:
    Tech Stack Advantages:
    Automation & maintenance: WordPress Plugin Development: WordPress has a vast ecosystem of plugins and tools that streamline development and automate various tasks
    Allows for efficient communication with external APIs, enabling automation of data retrieval and display. By using Wordpress CMS, it provides an easy to 
    maintain, modular approach that allow us to also easily update its content. 
    SEO Performance: Wordpress have several SEO Plugins such as Yoast or Rank Math, that helps our page to be more optimized for search engines.

    Tech Stack Disadvantages:
    Automation & maintenance: These plugins counterpart is that any update they suffer will require manual update. Also in terms of maintenance, dependance of external api's may 
    introduce unexpected point of failures when these don't work properly. 
    SEO Performance: Optimization its crutial for a Wordpress site since it might suffer from bloat, this has an impact on SEO performance. 

2. Mitigating Negative Impact on Page Load Times due to Additional Metadata Fields:
    This bloating can be improved by several mechanish such as: client/server side caching that would improve the response times and data availability for the 
    system, lazy loading whenever a large amount of resources are downloaded from the server, configuration of a CDN (Content Delivery Network) through our cloud 
    provider; to improve the performance on data pulling from the server. 

3. Planning for Future Updates of the Plugin, Versioning, and Safe Deployment:
    By using semantic versioning, we would ensure a proper protocol to control each release made to the plugin, along with its documentation and a proper release notes
    of the changes made in that version. This would provide a easy to read guide for any user interested on using the plugin.
    
    The deployment process can be refined using automated CI/CD Pipelines under a set of tests that would control if that release is suitable to be deployed or not,
    also by deploying first to a staging environment we could guarantee the detection of any possible issue that might arise during its tests.

    As is made in any important release, defining a rollback plan is esential to the deployment process, in case of anything goes wrong, then we'd have a guideline 
    to revert the changes we made in that specific release.
